# Quoter application 
---
Tiny CLJS app - [Quote generator (demo)](https://r-quoter.herokuapp.com/). 
Original(for me) idea - [Clojurescript - Random Quote Generator](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa-MaCmS0gk&ab_channel=KelvinMai)

My goal was write tiny ClojureScript appication and go through all the main stages of the client application development cycle at the basic level - coding(CLJS), styling(CSS, Garden), adapting to different devices(flex, media-queries), build(shadow-cljs), launch(Nginx, Docker) and deploy(Heroku)
